## Manual and Exploratory Testing :pencil2:

### Planned Manual Testing
Designated testers and test leads organize tests into plans and suites.

### User Acceptance Testing
User acceptance testers ensure the delivered product meets customer requirements.

### Exploratory Testing
Developers, testers, UX teams, and others explore the software without predefined test plans.

### Stakeholder Feedback
Testing by external stakeholders, like marketing and sales teams, using the browser-based extension Azure Test Feedback.

## Automated Testing :robot:

### Integration with Azure Pipelines ðŸš€
Azure Test Plans works seamlessly with Azure Pipelines for continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD).

### Result Capture and Review ðŸ“ƒ
Pipeline tasks capture and publish test results, which can be reviewed using progress and pipeline reports.

## Traceability :link:

### Linking to User Stories/Requirements
Test cases and suites are linked to user stories, features, or requirements for end-to-end traceability.
It helps in tracking the quality of requirements.

## Reporting and Analysis :chart_with_upwards_trend:

### Configurable Tracking
Progress can be tracked through configurable charts and test-specific widgets on dashboards.

### Built-in Reports
Various built-in reports, such as Progress reports, pipeline test result reports, and Analytics services, aid in result tracking and progress monitoring.
