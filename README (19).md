  git push -u origin all
  ```
  Note: Make sure to update your Azure repo in the above command

- Go to the Azure Portal and Create the Azure App Service by following the instructions in the video

*  A trigger tells a Pipeline to run. It could be CI or Scheduled, manual(if not specified), or after another build finishes.
*  A pipeline is made up of one or more stages. A pipeline can deploy to one or more environments.
*  A stage organizes jobs in a pipeline, and each stage can have one or more jobs.
*  Each job runs on one agent, such as Ubuntu, Windows, macOS, etc. A job can also be agentless.
*  Each agent runs a job that contains one or more steps.
*  A step can be a task or script and is the smallest building block of a pipeline.
*  A task is a pre-packaged script that performs an action, such as invoking a REST API or publishing a build artifact.
*  An artifact is a collection of files or packages published by a run.
