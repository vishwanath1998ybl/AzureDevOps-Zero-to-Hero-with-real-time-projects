### Ways to setup self-hosted agents: 
- Azure Virtual Machine
- Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets (VMSS)
- Containers etc.
  
### What is a Virtual machine scale set
- A group of one or more identical Virtual machines that can be scaled out and scaled in based on the demand/schedule and manual actions.
- This ensures high availability and fault tolerance so that if one VM crashes, another gets provisioned using the template.
- This is similar to AWS AutoScaling Groups or GCP Managed Instance Groups.
